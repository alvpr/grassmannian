# Grassmanniann Constellations for MIMO Noncoherent Communicaitons
Structure famlily of grassmanniann constellations for MIMO noncoherent communicaitons. The proposed constellationdesign is built upon the geodesic curves of the Grassmann manifold, thereby exploiting its underlying geometric structure. A preprint version of the paper explaining this desing can be found at.

In this repository some constellations obtained with this approach can be found. Variables are:

T -> Duration of the coherence block in symbols.
M -> Number of transmit antennas.
L -> Constellation size or number of points.
N -> Number of receive antennas.
