# Grassmannian Constellations for MIMO Noncoherent Communications

Structure family of Grassmannian constellations for MIMO noncoherent communications. The proposed constellation design is built upon the geodesic curves of the Grassmann manifold, thereby exploiting its underlying geometric structure. Remarkably, the obtained space-time constellations have a single nonzero entry per row, meaning that a single antenna is active in transmission per time slot.

A preprint version of the paper explaining this design can be found at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15070

This repository contains examples of constellations obtained with this approach. Variables are:

- T -> Duration of the coherence block in symbols.
- M -> Number of transmit antennas.
- L -> Constellation size or number of points.
- N -> Number of receive antennas.
